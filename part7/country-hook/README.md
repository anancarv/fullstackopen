# Countries exercises with custom hooks

In this exercise, we made a new version of the countries exercise from part 2 using custom hooks.

This application is used to search for country details from the https://restcountries.eu/ interface. If country is found, the details of the country are displayed.

## Start the application

To start an application, do the following :

```bash
# Install dependancies
$ npm install

# Start the application
$ npm start
```

You can then access the app on : [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
