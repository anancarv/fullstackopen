    <p>According to Wikipedia:</p>

    <em>
      An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an
      incident. Occasionally humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their
      primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter but to reveal a truth
      more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person
      by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea
      about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short
      narrative. An anecdote is &quot;a story with a point.&quot;
    </em>

    <p>
      Software engineering is full of excellent anecdotes, at this app you can
      find the best and add more.
