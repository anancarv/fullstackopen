# Bloglist frontend

In this exercise, we will refactor the Bloglist application that we worked on in parts four and five for it to use Redux for the application's state management. We also used `React Router` for conditional rendering of components based on the url in the browser, as well as `React Bootstrap` for styling our application.

We assume that a user already exist in the database with the good credentials. If not, please head to part 4 for creating a new user using the API.

## Start the application locally

To start an application:

```bash
# First, you need to start the backend, to do so, head to the part4. Everything is explained in the README

# Install dependancies
$ npm install

# Start the frontend application
$ npm start
```

You can then access the app on : http://localhost:3000/
